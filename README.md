# This is #Task1 of my data science and business analytics internship at the Sparks Foundation. This is a simple prediction model using supervised ML.

## We are to build a regression model to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. Here Scores refers to the percentage of marks obtained by the student and Hours refers to the number of hours a student studies in a day.

### Scores is the response variable or dependent variable and  study Hours is the predictor variable or the independent variable. The entire code is explained in the R markdown file.
